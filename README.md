# GL_client-serverAplication_withUsingNio_and_end-to-endEncryption
Here is a NIO project with client-server technology, but without end-to-end encryption. 
Okay this project has Encrypter.java class, but it never used.

To start chat beatwens two clients you need: 
1) Start the server
2) Start two clients (Server will automaticly give id for clients, id starts from "0")
3) Send message from one client to anouther in format like "RECEIVERID : MESSAGE" (e. g. 0 : Hello!)
